Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Kevin, a self-taught developer from Kisumu, Kenya, passionate about building AI solutions to empower underserved communities. This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and mission to bridge the digital divide using technology. 🚀

## About Me 🌍

Growing up in Kenya, I’ve seen the challenges of language barriers and limited digital access. My goal is to create inclusive tools like the Sheng-Dholuo Translator and a digital marketplace, empowering local youth and traders.
